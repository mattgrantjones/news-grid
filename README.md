# News Feed Grid Play

Create a basic news feed grid UI using data contained in a single JSON file, based on a supplied design.
Rather than hit a DB, I've stored the JSON locally and set up server mocking to mimick fetching.
I've used React with Vite, TailwindCSS, SWR for the fetching and MSW for mocking.

Now added mobile styles for the grid.
